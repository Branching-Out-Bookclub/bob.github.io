This book was selected by your mods out of the category of memoir and will be read from June 3 - July 7.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

“I first read Machado’s memoir several years ago and was immediately captivated by her unique writing style. Memoir, research article, and real life psychological horror, Machado reflects on what happened, but also why and how she ended up in, and stayed in, an abusive relationship. It can be a difficult read at times, but I'm confident it will foster meaningful discussion.”

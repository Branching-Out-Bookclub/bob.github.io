The mod team selected the genre of _poetry_ and the final book was selected by you, our members! Despite a tight race between the top three contenders, Chen Chen managed to hold its lead until the end.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion:

â€œI love so many poetry collections, but this is one of the first ones that come to mind when asked for recommendations. Chen Chen has been a favorite of mine for years, but I actually only got around to reading this collection last year--and then kicked myself for not reading it sooner. It's incredible (and fun fact, I read a poem from this book as part of my wedding vows). I can't wait to hear what you all think of it!"

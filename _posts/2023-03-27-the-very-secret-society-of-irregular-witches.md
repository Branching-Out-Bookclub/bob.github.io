This book was selected by all of you as part of our community pick process and will be read from March 27 - May 7.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

“Since the last few books have been centered around serious topics (like climate change), I thought The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches would be a nice, cozy, lighthearted read that still touches the themes and values that make this book club tick. Plus I think a lot of us are suckers for the Found Family trope.”

This book was selected by your mods out of the _contemporary fiction_ genre. 

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

â€œThis is a book that did the impossible by both making me laugh out loud and cry. It takes an absurd premise (a self-proclaimed atheist lesbian who accidentally gets employed at a Catholic church) and uses it to explore mental health. In doing so it takes a hard and sometimes difficult to discuss topic, and treats it with both humour and kindness. I hope it will give us lots to talk about!

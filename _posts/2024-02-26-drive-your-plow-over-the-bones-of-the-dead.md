This book was selected by your mods out of the category of _translated fiction_, and was originally published in Polish.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

"This book is the definition of unsound woman fiction, and when I first read it I was captivated. It is bizarre, mysterious and slightly unhinged in a way that absolutely worked for me, and that I hope will work for you too. At the very least, I hope it gives us lots to talk about! Including more beetles and the art of translation."

This book was chosen for you by the mods, from the Top Twenty list of LL community picks. It was the only book that was a top contender in all three years of LL, and what better way to start off our new book club than with something folks have been excited to read! We do recognize that this book is much more of a "best seller" than previous Life's Library books, and many of you may already have read it. Our plan going forward is to select books that reflect our desire to read broadly and diversely. We hope that with a shorter announcement period than in the past, the fact it is a widely read book will make it easier to access and help ease the transition to sourcing books ourselves. 

Good Omens is a lighthearted book, but it does contain some challenging topics. We want to read and engage with the book and each other generously, but taking care of yourself is paramount. Content warnings for this book include death, violence, homophobia, racism, and car accidents.

We are looking forward to discussing Good Omens with you! See you in the branches!

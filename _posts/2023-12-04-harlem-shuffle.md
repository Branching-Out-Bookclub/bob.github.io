The mod team selected the genre of _historical fiction_ and the final book was selected by you, our members! 

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion: 

â€œI was super engaged with this book the whole way through and feel like there's a lot to talk about with it. It almost felt like it had a couple different stories inside one book, but in a way that completely worked."

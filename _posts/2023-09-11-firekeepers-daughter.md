This book was selected by your mods out of the _suspense_ genre.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

"I thought this book suited the suspense/mystery/thriller theme perfectly as well as being a fascinating look into Ojibwe culture, and a young woman's complicated experience as a biracial individual looking for belonging. It covers a wide range of topics and I'm hoping Firekeeper's Daughter is a book everyone can get something out of."

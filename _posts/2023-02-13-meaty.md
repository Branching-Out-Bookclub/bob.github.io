This book was selected by your mod team, based on the winning genre of _humour_, selected in our community poll.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion: 

“I remember finding this book like reading someone's inner monologue (maybe especially so because I listened to it). Irby writes about topics that are often viewed as socially unacceptable to talk about in a self-deprecating and irreverent way that I enjoyed (her laconic drawl is a delight to listen to). I found some essays very relatable, others broadening or challenging, and some just for levity. Humour is very subjective and difficult to recommend but I hope everyone can get something out of this pick.”

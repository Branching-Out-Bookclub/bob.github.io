This book was selected by your mod team, based on the winning genre of _fantasy_, selected in our community poll.

The mod who nominated the book for mod consideration, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion:

“Like many of my favourite books, this one was recommended to me by a friend in Life’s Library. I remember being immediately enchanted by the lyrical storytelling and the fairytale-like world. I mean, it really has everything you could want: a misunderstood witch, a governing body who aren’t what they seem, a pocket sized dragon, and a girl fed magic from the moon. I will also add to not be put off by the “middle grade” label. I was actually shocked to learn this book was not marketed for adults or at least YA. While it may be written for a younger audience, it managed to capture my imagination and completely immerse me in the story. I hope you all have the same experience!”

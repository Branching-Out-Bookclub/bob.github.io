The mod team selected the genre of _non-fiction_ and the final book was selected by you, our members!

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion: 

“In Pandora’s Jar, Natalie writes about different women in Greek myths and looks at how their stories have been written and retold, mostly by men, through generations and aims to centre and reframe their stories. Natalie has a background in Classics and stand-up comedy which produces a book that is written both with a deep understanding of her subject and provides levity at just the right moment as the stories often get dark - these are Greek Myths being examined, after all! I was introduced to Natalie Haynes by a close friend and find her engaging, accessible and entertainingly nerdy with her pop culture references. I hope you all find this as enlightening and enjoyable as I did.”

This book was selected by your mod team, based on the winning genre of _historical fiction_, selected in our community poll.

The mod who nominated the book for mod consideration, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion:

“The Yield is an unusual take on historical fiction, weaving together the past and the present. It centers Aboriginal Australian history, told by an Indigenous Australian author, and I so value the rare instances when own-voices tell history, particularly around colonization. It is not an easy book, but I found it beautiful, captivating and moving, especially the way it captures the richness of the Wiradjuri language and highlights the importance of Indigenous peoples and their languages as part of caring for our world. ”

This book was selected by your mods out of the _science fiction_ genre.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion:

"I suggested this book because it's such a fun mash-up of different genres. Science-fiction is part of it, of course, but also mystery, humour, the classics, and a dash of fantasy. It features a detective travelling into Jane Eyre to solve a disappearance, cheese conflicts, genetically engineered dodos, and government agencies concerned with Shakespeare conspiracies. This book has it all, and it's laugh-out-loud funny, which we can all use as we move into the darker part of the year. (And no you donâ€™t need to know the plot of Jane Eyre)"

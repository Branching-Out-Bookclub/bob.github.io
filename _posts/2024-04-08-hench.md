This book was selected by all of you as part of our community pick process and will be read from April 8 - May 19.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

“Hench has lots of things that appeal to me—complicated "heroes"! disability rep! spreadsheets!—and I had a feeling a lot of those things would appeal to other BoB readers too. I'm hoping it will both be fun to read and give us lots to discuss.”

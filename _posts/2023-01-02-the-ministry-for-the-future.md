This book was selected by your mod team, based on the winning genre of _science fiction_, selected in our community poll. 

The mod who nominated the book for mod consideration, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion:

“Climate change is hard and scary, and that sometimes makes it hard to imagine possible ways through it. This book, more than any number of non-fiction, solution-focused guides to climate action, brought home the real possibility that we can make changes that really matter. It’s real hope in the dark for me, and I hope I can be for you as well.”

p.s. she says that even though it's on the longer side, the book is very readable!

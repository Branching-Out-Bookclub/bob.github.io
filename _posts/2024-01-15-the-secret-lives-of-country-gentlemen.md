This book was selected by your mods out of the _romance_ genre.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion:

“I really love KJ Charles' books and this is definitely one of her strong ones. Her explorations of morality, legality and how the two can be at odds is really well done in this book. I also appreciate how her characters often experience difficulties because of the society and time they live in rather than because of bad communication skills. The sense of place in this book is another thing that really stuck with me. I hope everyone enjoys what I think is a great example of a classic romance novel that also has a fair amount of intrigue, suspense, and beetles.”

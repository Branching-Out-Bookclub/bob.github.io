This book was selected by your mods out of the _micro-history_ genre.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion: 

‚ÄúI took micro-history very literally with this one. What drew me in was the Whitman inspired title, often quoted by John Green. What kept me interested was the topic, about which I know very little but would like to know more. What sealed the deal was the library where I work just wrapped up reading another of Ed Yong's books and reviews were favorable. You seem like the perfect group of nerds to read this with. ü§ì ‚Äù
